# 11/06 Swarm

## Status
- Display incoming and outgoing invitations
- Messages have status field (accepted, rejected, pending)
- We have accept and reject buttons
- "View all" directs to profile

## Priorities
- Refactor UI to look pretty (maybe NU colors)
- Fix invitation display after accepted or displayed
  - Sorting/order
  - Separate resolved messages?
- Add linkedin (external links)
- No edit page by default (add additional button)
- Food preference
- ratings?

## Conclusion
- Fixed non-first time user not being redirected to landing page
- Refactored profile card UI/layout to look pretty with less whitespace
- Implement two different sections: one for pending invitations, one for past invitations
- Display the message body to the outgoing invitations as well
- Display timestamp of messages (added a timestamp field)

## Todo
- External website link (github, linkedin, etc)
- Refactor UI to look pretty (maybe NU colors)
- Food preference
- ratings?
- No edit page by default (add additional button)
- Sort invitations by timestamp

# reflections
- We should have people who miss swarms implement a small feature at home
- Communicate better on swarming schedule (if missing, let people know well ahead of time)
- Today was aight.
